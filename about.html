                    Hello, I'm Griffin, a web developer who loves figuring out how things work. From building my own
                    computers to hosting my own web servers, I dive in headfirst and learn by doing. Every new
                    technology is a chance to experiment, tinker, and level up my skills. I enjoy exploring both
                    front-end and back-end development to see how all the pieces fit together.
                </p>

            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    When I step away from screens, you'll probably find me outdoors hiking, camping, fishing, or
                    chasing the perfect landscape shot with my camera. You may also spot me in the gym lifting weights,
                    or out on the golf course screaming 'FORE'. These activities give me fresh perspectives, balance,
                    and inspiration that carry over into everything I build.
                </p>

                    At the end of the day, I'm a lifelong learner with a love for tech and building solutions. Whether
                    it's building a custom PC, photographing a sunset, or deploying a web app, I'm always
                    looking for the next challenge and I'm excited to see where it leads.
